## About Me
Hi! I'm a junior CS student, transferred from San Diego Miramar College. I'm trying to learn everything but not a pro of anything.  


I'm from Taiwan, this is my favorite food -- stinky tofu.  
It smells bad but it tastes so good!  
The photo below is the stinky tofu near by my house. It's a really small shop but it's the best stinky tofu I've ever had.

My favoraite flaver is macha, I like all the dessert in macha.  
I also named my cat as macha, but she's in Taiwan. I miss her so muchðŸ˜­.
